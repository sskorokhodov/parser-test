Plans
-----

- add ability to get node by its name (std::map? Should it be multimap with
ability to iterate over equally named nodes with "next()"?)
- add Writer to save nodes structure in source format
- doxygen comments
- unit-tests
- to use more C++ 11 features
- to make as many work as possible at compilation time
